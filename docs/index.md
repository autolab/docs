# Welcome to the Autolab Docs

Autolab is a course management and homework autograding platform that enables instructors to offer programming labs to their students. It includes gradebooks, rosters, handins/handouts, lab writeups, code annotation, manual grading, late penalties, grace days, cheat checking, meetings, partners, and bulk emails.

## Getting Started

For information on how to use Autolab go to the [instructors page](/instructors). To learn how to write an autograded lab go to the [lab authors page](/lab)

Autolab consists of two services, the Ruby on Rails frontend and Tango, the Python grading server. In order, to use all features
of Autolab, we highly recommend installing both services.

Currently, we have support for installation on [Ubuntu 14.04+](#ubuntu-14.04+) and [Mac OSX](#Mac-OSX)
