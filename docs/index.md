# Welcome to the Autolab Docs

Autolab is a course management platform that enables instructors to offer autograded programming assignments to their students. The two key  ideas in Autolab are *autograding* that is, programs evaluating other programs, and *scoreboards* that display the latest autograded scores for each student. Autolab also provides gradebooks, rosters, handins/handouts, lab writeups, code annotation, manual grading, late penalties, grace days, cheat checking, meetings, partners, and bulk emails.

For information on how to use Autolab for your course see the [Guide for Instructors](/instructors). To learn how to write an autograded lab see the [Guide for Lab Authors](/lab).

## Getting Started

Autolab consists of two services: (1) the Ruby on Rails frontend, and (2) [Tango](/tango), the RESTful Python autograding server. Either service can run independently without the other. But in order to use all features of Autolab, we highly recommend installing both services.

Currently, we have support for installing Autolab on [Ubuntu 14.04+](#ubuntu-1404) and [Mac OSX](#mac-osx).

### Installing on Ubuntu 14.04+

There are two ways to install Autolab on Ubuntu:

Option 1. The recommended way is to use the [OneClick option](/one-click). This option uses Docker to provide a complete installation of the Autolab frontend and Tango, for either development or production. The idea is that you download a single installation repo and then run a single setup script. When the script finishes, you have a complete working instance of Autolab and Tango that you can a point a browser at and begin using right away. Because it provides things like integration with SSL certificates and mail services, this option is specially useful for installing on external services like Heroku, EC2, or other Ubuntu VM providers like DigitalOcean.

Option 2:  Another option is to install the frontend and Tango manually, without using Docker. This gives you more control over the installation, but is only appropriate for advanced users with knowledge of the Unix command line, Rails, and Ruby Gems. To install the Autolab frontend in developer mode, you run the following script:

```bash
AUTOLAB_SCRIPT=`mktemp` && \curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autolab/Autolab/master/bin/setup.sh > $AUTOLAB_SCRIPT && \bash $AUTOLAB_SCRIPT
```

When the script runs, you will be prompted for the `sudo` password and other confirmations. You can see the details of the script [here](https://github.com/autolab/Autolab/blob/master/bin/setup.sh). If you want autograding, then you will need to manually [install Tango](/tango).

### Installing on Mac OSX 10.11+

Follow the step-by-step instructions below:

1. Install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) (use the Basic GitHub Checkout method)

2. Install [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) as an rbenv plugin:
		
		:::bash
        git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
   Restart your shell at this point in order to start using your newly installed rbenv
        

3. Install the correct version of ruby:
        
        :::bash
        rbenv install $(cat .ruby-version)
   At this point, confirm that `rbenv` is working (you might need to restart your shell):
        
        :::bash
        $ which ruby
        ~/.rbenv/shims/ruby

        $ which rake
        ~/.rbenv/shims/rake

4. Install `bundler`:
        
        :::bash
        gem install bundler
        rbenv rehash

5. Clone the Autolab repo into any desired directory:
        
        :::bash
        git clone https://github.com/autolab/Autolab.git

6. Install the required gems (run the following commands in the cloned Autolab repo):

        :::bash
        cd bin
        bundle install
   Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) for issues installing gems

7. Install one of two database options

    * [SQLite](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm) should **only** be used in development
    * [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/osx-installation-pkg.html) can be used in development or production

8. Configure your database:
      
        :::bash
        cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml
   Edit `database.yml` with the correct credentials for your chosen database. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) for any issues.

9. Configure the Devise Auth System with a unique key (run these commands exactly):

        :::bash
        cp config/nitializers/devise.rb.template config/initializers/devise.rb
        sed -i "s/<YOUR-SECRET-KEY>/`bundle exec rake secret`/g" initializers/devise.rb
   Fill in `<YOUR_WEBSITE>` in `config/initializers/devise.rb` file. To skip this step for now, fill with `foo.bar`.

10. Configure school/organization specific information (new feature):
        
        :::bash
        cp config/school.yml.template config/school.yml
    Edit `school.yml` with your school/organization specific names and emails

11. Create and initialize the database tables:

        :::bash
        bundle exec rake db:create
    Do not forget to use `bundle exec` in front of every rake/rails command.

12. Populate dummy data (development only):
        
        :::bash
        bundle exec rake autolab:populate

13. Start the rails server:

        :::bash
        bundle exec rails s -p 3000

14. Go to localhost:3000 and login with `Developer Login`:
      
        :::bash
        Email: "admin@foo.bar".

15. Install [Tango](/tango), the backend autograding service.

16. Now you are all set to start using Autolab! Visit the [Guide for Instructors](/instructors) and [Guide for Lab Authors](/lab) pages for more info.
 
## FAQ

This is a general list of questions that we get often. If you find a solution to an issue not mentioned here,
please contact us at <autolab-dev@andrew.cmu.edu>

####Ubuntu Script Bugs
If you get the following error
```bash
Failed to fetch http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/dists/stable/Release  
Unable to find expected entry 'main/binary-i386/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)
``` 
then follow the solution in [this post](http://askubuntu.com/questions/743814/unable-to-find-expected-entry-main-binary-i386-packages-chrome). 

####Where do I find the MySQL username and password?
If this is your first time logging into MySQL, your username is 'root'. You may also need to set the root password:

Start the server:
```bash
sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start
```

Set the password:
```bash
mysqladmin -u root password "[New_Password]"
```

If you lost your root password, refer to the [MySQL wiki](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/resetting-permissions.html)

####Bundle Install Errors
This happens as gems get updated. These fixes are gem-specific, but two common ones are

`eventmachine`
```bash
bundle config build.eventmachine --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
```

`libv8`
```bash
bundle config build.libv8 --with-system-v8
```

Run `bundle install` again

If this still does not work, try exploring [this StackOverflow link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23536893/therubyracer-gemextbuilderror-error-failed-to-build-gem-native-extension)

####Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
Make sure you've started the MySQL server and double-check the socket in `config/database.yml`

The default socket location is `/tmp/mysql.sock`.

#### I forgot my MySQL root password
You can reset it following the instructions on [this Stack Overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6474775/setting-the-mysql-root-user-password-on-os-x)

If `mysql` complains that the password is expired, follow the instructions on the second answer on [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33326065/unable-to-access-mysql-after-it-automatically-generated-a-temporary-password)
