The two key ideas in Autolab are autograding that is, programs evaluating other programs, and scoreboards that display the latest autograded scores for each student. Autolab also provides gradebooks, rosters, handins/handouts, lab writeups, code annotation, manual grading, late penalties, grace days, cheat checking, meetings, partners, and bulk emails. For information on how to use Autolab for your course see the Guide for Instructors . To learn how to write an autograded lab see the Guide for Lab Authors . To get straight to an installation, go to Getting Started Demonstration Site If you would like to check out Autolab prior to installation, go over to our Demo Site ! Login through Developer Login with the email: admin@foo.bar . This is a demonstration website. It refreshes at 0,6,12,18 Hours (UTC) daily, and it is publicly accessible, so please only use it for your exploration. Do not use this site to store important information. Try the following in order: Create a new course Click on Manage Autolab (top-right navigation bar) > Create New Course . Fill in the name and semester, and then create to see your course on the homepage. (NOTE: the email doesn't need to be real here) Create an Autograded Lab Assessment. Go into the course you have just created, click on Install Assessment . You can install a simple autograded lab, called hello lab. Download hello.tar and install it using the Import from Tarball option. In the hello lab, students are asked to write a file called hello.c . The autograder checks that the submitted hello.c program compiles and runs with an exit status of zero. If so, the submission gets 100 points. Otherwise it gets 0 points. Try submitting to the autograded hello lab Create and submit a hello.c file. # hello . c # include < stdio . h > int main () { printf ( \" Hello, World! \" ) ; return 0 ; } Refresh the submitted entries page to see the autograded score appear Click on a sub score, in this case the 100.0 under the Correctness heading, to see the output from the autograder. For more information on hello lab, or how to create your own lab, go to Guide for Lab Authors ! Create a PDF homework assessment Autolab can also handle pdf submissions as well! Click on Install Assessment , then on Assessment Builder . Name your assessment, and give it a category and click Create Assessment !. Because it defaults to accepting .c files, we would like to change it to *.pdf . Click on Edit Assessment > Handin and then change the Handin filename to handin.pdf instead of handin.c and save the changes Try submitting to the pdf homework asssessment. Submit a .pdf file. Download Blank PDF Look at your submission using the magnifying glass icon Grading submissions Click on Grade Submissions , and then the arrow button to open up student submissions. For details on the relevant features for an Instructor, go to Guide for Instructor Getting Started Autolab consists of two services: (1) the Ruby on Rails frontend, and (2) Tango , the RESTful Python autograding server. Either service can run independently without the other. But in order to use all features of Autolab, we highly recommend installing both services. Currently, we have support for installing Autolab on AWS , Ubuntu 14.04+ , and Mac OSX . AWS If you want to try Autolab or Tango without any installation, we have a pre-built AMI you can deploy on AWS' free tier. To deploy it, follow the official EC2 Launch Instructions . Make sure that you Select 'Autolab vx.x.x' as the ami. You can find this in the community amis tab. Make sure you're using atleast a 30GB volume on the Add Storage tab. On the Configure Security Group tab, add rules to allow ports 80 and 8600. Once your EC2 Instance is up, you can ssh into it using ssh -i <aws_key>.pem ubuntu@<Public DNS> and follow the instructions in readme.txt Mac OSX 10.11+ Follow the step-by-step instructions below: Install rbenv (use the Basic GitHub Checkout method) Install ruby-build as an rbenv plugin: git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build Restart your shell at this point in order to start using your newly installed rbenv Clone the Autolab repo into home directory and enter it: cd ~/ git clone https://github.com/autolab/Autolab.git && cd Autolab Install the correct version of ruby: rbenv install $( cat .ruby-version ) At this point, confirm that rbenv is working (you might need to restart your shell): $ which ruby ~/.rbenv/shims/ruby $ which rake ~/.rbenv/shims/rake Install bundler : gem install bundler rbenv rehash Install the required gems (run the following commands in the cloned Autolab repo): cd bin bundle install Refer to the FAQ for issues installing gems Install one of two database options SQLite should only be used in development MySQL can be used in development or production Configure your database: cp config/database.yml.template config/database.yml Edit database.yml with the correct credentials for your chosen database. Refer to the FAQ for any issues. Configure school/organization specific information (new feature): cp config/school.yml.template config/school.yml Edit school.yml with your school/organization specific names and emails Configure the Devise Auth System with a unique key (run these commands exactly - leave <YOUR-SECRET-KEY> as it is): cp config/initializers/devise.rb.template config/initializers/devise.rb sed -i \"s/<YOUR-SECRET-KEY>/`bundle exec rake secret`/g\" config/initializers/devise.rb Fill in <YOUR_WEBSITE> in the config/initializers/devise.rb file. To skip this step for now, fill with foo.bar . Create and initialize the database tables: bundle exec rake db:create bundle exec rake db:migrate Do not forget to use bundle exec in front of every rake/rails command. Populate dummy data (development only): bundle exec rake autolab:populate Start the rails server: bundle exec rails s -p 3000 Go to localhost:3000 and login with Developer Login : Email: \"admin@foo.bar\" . Install Tango , the backend autograding service. Now you are all set to start using Autolab! Visit the Guide for Instructors and Guide for Lab Authors pages for more info. Ubuntu 14.04+ There are two ways to install Autolab on Ubuntu. Option 1 The recommended way is to use the OneClick option . This option uses Docker to provide a complete installation of the Autolab frontend and Tango, for either development or production. Because it provides things like integration with SSL certificates and mail services, this option is specially useful for installing on external services like Heroku, EC2, DigitalOcean, or other Ubuntu VPS providers. Option 2 Another option is to install the frontend and Tango manually, without using Docker. This gives you more control over the installation, but is only appropriate for advanced users with knowledge of the Unix command line, Rails, and Ruby Gems. To install the Autolab frontend in developer mode, run the following script: AUTOLAB_SCRIPT = ` mktemp ` && \\c url -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autolab/Autolab/master/bin/setup.sh > $AUTOLAB_SCRIPT && \\b ash $AUTOLAB_SCRIPT When the script runs, you will be prompted for the sudo password and other confirmations. You can see the details of the script here . Once finished, install Tango . Ubuntu 18.04+ (rails-5-upgrade) This set of instruction is meant to install the currently in-development version of AutoLab located at rails-5-upgrade on 18.04 LTS.

With the API, developers will be able to help make Autolab more versatile and convenient: Whether it be with a mobile app, a command line tool, a browser extension, or something we've never even thought of. For students and instructors who only plan to use Autolab, try out the Autolab CLI . The Autolab REST API allows developers to create clients that can access features of Autolab on behalf of Autolab users. V1 of the API allows clients to: Access basic user info View courses and assessments Submit to assessments View scores and feedback Manage course enrollments Authorization All endpoints of the Autolab API requires client authentication in the form of an access token. To obtain this access token, clients must obtain authorization from the user. Autolab API uses the standard OAuth2 Authorization Code Grant for user authorization. For clients with no easy access to web browsers (e.g. console apps), an alternative device flow -based authorization method is provided as well. To understand how to authorize and unauthorize clients as a user, go to Managing Authorized Apps Authorization Code Grant Flow The authorization code grant consists of 5 basic steps: Client directs the user to the authorization request endpoint via a web browser. Authorization server (Autolab) authenticates the user. If user grants access to the client, the authorization server provides an \"authorization code\" to the client. Client exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the access token endpoint. Client uses the access token for subsequent requests to the API. The endpoint for obtaining user authorization is /oauth/authorize The endpoint for obtaning access tokens and refresh tokens is oauth/token Section 4.1 of RFC 6749 details the parameters required and the response clients can expect from these endpoints. Autolab API provides a refresh token with every new access token. Once the access token has expired, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new access token, refresh token pair. Details are also provided in RFC 6749 here . Device Flow For devices that cannot use a web browser to obtain user authorization, the alternative device flow approach circumvents the first 3 steps in the authorization code grant flow. Instead of directing a user to the authorization page directly, the client obtains a user code that the user can enter on the Autolab website from any device. The website then takes the user through the authorization procedure, and returns the authorization code to the client. The client can then use this code to request an access token from the access token endpoint as usual. Note that this is different from the \"device flow\" described in the Internet Draft linked above. Obtaining User Code Request Endpoint: GET /oauth/device_flow_init Parameters: client_id: the client_id obtained when registering the client Success Response: device_code: the verification code used by the client (should be kept secret from the user). user_code: the verification code that should be displayed to the user. verification_uri: the verification uri that the user should use to authorize the client. By default is /activate The latter two should be displayed to the user. Obtaining Authorization Code After asking the user to enter the user code on the verification site, the client should poll the device_flow_authorize endpoint to find out if the user has completed the authorization step. Request Endpoint: GET /oauth/device_flow_authorize Parameters: client_id: the client_id obtained when registering the client device_code: the device_code obtained from the device_flow_init endpoint Failure Responses: 400 Bad Request: {error: authorization_pending} The user has not yet granted or denied the authorization request. Please try again in a while. 429 Too Many Requests: {error: Retry later} The client is polling too frequently. Please wait for a while before polling again. The default rate limit is once every 5 seconds. Success Response: code: the authorization code that should be used to obtain an access token. The client could then perform steps 4 and 5 of the Authorization Code Grant Flow. Getting Started Autolab requires all client applications to be registered clients. Upon registration, a client_id and client_secret pair will be provided to the developers for use in the app as identification to the server. Please contact the administrators of your specific Autolab deployment for registration. Security Concerns Please make sure to keep the client_secret secret. Leaking this code may allow third-parties to impersonate your app. Scopes The scopes of an API client specifies the permissions it has, and must be specified during client registration (can be modified later). Currently, Autolab offers the following scopes for third-party clients: user_info: Access your basic info (e.g. name, email, school, year). user_courses: Access your courses and assessments. user_scores: Access your submissions, scores, and feedback. user_submit: Submit to assessments on your behalf. instructor_all: Access admin options of courses where you are an instructor. Example usages If your app only wants to use the API for quick user authentication, you only need the 'user_info' scope. If you want to develop a mobile client for Autolab that allows students to view their upcoming assessments, you may ask for 'user_info' and 'user_courses'. If you want to write a full desktop client that users can use to submit to assessments and view their grades, you may ask for all 5 scopes. Of course, these are only examples. We can't wait to see what new usages of the API you may come up with! We just recommend that you only ask for the scopes you need as the users will be shown the required scopes during authorization, and it gives them peace of mind to know that an app doesn't ask for excessive permissions.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"api-overview/#overview","text":"The web interface that has served us well for many years is no longer the only way to use Autolab.

Currently, Autolab offers the following scopes for third-party clients: user_info: Access your basic info (e.g. name, email, school, year). user_courses: Access your courses and assessments. user_scores: Access your submissions, scores, and feedback. user_submit: Submit to assessments on your behalf. instructor_all: Access admin options of courses where you are an instructor. Example usages If your app only wants to use the API for quick user authentication, you only need the 'user_info' scope. If you want to develop a mobile client for Autolab that allows students to view their upcoming assessments, you may ask for 'user_info' and 'user_courses'. If you want to write a full desktop client that users can use to submit to assessments and view their grades, you may ask for all 5 scopes. Of course, these are only examples. We can't wait to see what new usages of the API you may come up with! We just recommend that you only ask for the scopes you need as the users will be shown the required scopes during authorization, and it gives them peace of mind to know that an app doesn't ask for excessive permissions.","title":"Scopes"},{"location":"command-line-interface/","text":"Autolab Command Line Interface To help showcase the capabilities of the API, we developed autolab-cli: A first-party command line client that serves as both a practical tool for users of Autolab, as well as a reference design for developers intending to use the API in their own programs.

Features Documented (Work in Progress): Scoreboards Embedded Forms Scoreboards Scoreboards are a central concept of Autolab and are created by the output of Autograders . They anonomously rank students submitted assignments inspiring health competition and desire to improve. They are simple and highly customizable. Scoreboard's can be added/edited on the edit assessment screen ( /courses/<course>/assessments/<assessment>/edit ). In general, scoreboards are configured using a JSON string. Default Scoreboard The default scoreboard displays the total problem scores, followed by each individual problem score, sorted in descending order by the total score. Custom Scoreboards Autograded assignments have the option of creating custom scoreboards. You can specify your own custom scoreboard using a JSON column specification. The column spec consists of a \"scoreboard\" object, which is an array of JSON objects, where each object describes a column. Example: a scoreboard with one column, called Score . { \"scoreboard\" : [{ \"hdr\" : \"Score\" }] } A custom scoreboard sorts the first three columns, from left to right, in descending order. You can change the default sort order for a particular column by adding an optional \"asc:1\" element to its hash. Example: Scoreboard with two columns, \"Score\" and \"Ops\", with \"Score\" sorted descending, and then \"Ops\" ascending: { \"scoreboard\" : [{ \"hdr\" : \"Score\" }, { \"hdr\" : \"Ops\" , \"asc\" : 1 }] } Scoreboard Entries The values for each row in a custom scoreboard come directly from a scoreboard array object in the autoresult string produced by the Tango, the autograder. Example: Autoresult returning the score (97) for a single autograded problem called autograded , and a scoreboard entry with two columns: the autograded score ( Score ) and the number of operations ( Ops ): { \"scores\" : { \"autograded\" : 97 }, \"scoreboard\" : [ 97 , 128 ] } For more information on how to use Autograders and Scoreboards together, visit the Guide for Lab Authors . Embedded Forms This feature allows an instructor to create an assessment which does not require a file submission on the part of the student. Instead, when an assessment is created, the hand-in page for that assessment will display an HTML form of the instructor\u2019s design. When the student submits the form, the information is sent directly in JSON format to the Tango grading server for evaluation. Tango Required Tango is needed to use this feature. Please install Tango and connect it to Autolab before proceeding. Creating an Embedded Form Create an HTML file with a combination of the following elements. The HTML file need only include form elements, because it will automatically be wrapped in a <form></form> block when it is rendered on the page. In order for the JSON string (the information passed to the grader) to be constructed properly, your form elements must follow the following conventions: A unique name attribute A value attribute which corresponds to the correct answer to the question (unless it is a text field or text area) HTML Form Reference: Text Field (For short responses) < input type = \"\u201ctext\u201d\" name = \"\u201cquestion-1\u201d\" /> Text Area (For coding questions) < textarea name = \"\u201cquestion-2\u201d\" style = \"\u201cwidth:100%\u201d\" /> Radio Button (For multiple choice) < div class = \"\u201crow\" > < input name = \"\u201cquestion-3\u201d\" type = \"\u201cradio\u201d\" value = \"\u201cobject\u201d\" id = \"\u201cq3-1\u201d\" /> < label for = \"q3-1\" > Object </ label > < input name = \"\u201cquestion-3\u201d\" type = \"\u201cradio\u201d\" value = \"\u201cboolean\u201d\" id = \"\u201cq3-2\u201d\" /> < label for = \"\u201cq3-2\u201d\" > Boolean </ label > </ div > Dropdown (For multiple choice or select all that apply) < select multiple name = \"question-4\" > < option value = \"1\" > Option 1 </ option > < option value = \"2\" > Option 2 </ option > < option value = \"3\" > Option 3 </ option > </ select > Example Form (shown in screenshot above) < input type = \"text\" name = \"question-1\" id = \"q1\" placeholder = \"What's your name?\" /> < div class = \"row\" > < input name = \"question-2\" type = \"radio\" value = \"freshman\" id = \"q3-1\" /> < label for = \"q3-1\" > Freshman </ label > < input name = \"question-2\" type = \"radio\" value = \"sophomore\" id = \"q3-2\" /> < label for = \"q3-2\" > Sophomore </ label > < input name = \"question-2\" type = \"radio\" value = \"junior\" id = \"q3-3\" /> < label for = \"q3-3\" > Junior </ label > < input name = \"question-2\" type = \"radio\" value = \"senior\" id = \"q3-4\" /> < label for = \"q3-4\" > Senior </ label > </ div > < label for = \"q4\" > What's your favorite language? </ label > < select name = \"question-3\" id = \"q4\" > < option value = \"C\" > C </ option > < option value = \"Python\" > Python </ option > < option value = \"Java\" > Java </ option > </ select > Navigate to the Basic section of editing an assessment ( /courses/<course>/assessments/<assessment>/edit ), check the check box, and upload the HTML file. Ensure you submit the form by clicking Save at the bottom of the page. Grading an Embedded Form When a student submits a form, the form data is sent to Tango in the form of a JSON string in the file out.txt. In your grading script, parse the contents of out.txt as a JSON object. The JSON object will be a key-value pair data structure, so you can access the students response string ( value ) by its unique key (the name attribute). For the example form shown above, the JSON object will be as follows: { \"utf8\" : \"\u2713\" , \"authenticity_token\" : \"LONGAUTHTOKEN\" , \"submission[embedded_quiz_form_answer]\" : \"\" , \"question-1\" : \"John Smith\" , \"question-2\" : \"junior\" , \"question-3\" : \"Python\" , \"integrity_checkbox\" : \"1\" } Use this information to do any processing you need in Tango.If you find any problems, please file an issue on the Autolab Github .","title":"Advanced Features"},{"location":"features/#autolab-features-documentation","text":"This guide details the usage of features in Autolab.

It's meant to be read from beginning to end the first time. Users Users are either instructors , course assistants , or students . Instructors have full permissions. Course assistants are only allowed to enter grades. Students see only their own work. Each user is uniquely identified by their email address. You can change the permissions for a particular user at any time. Note that some instructors opt to give some or all of their TAs instructor status. Roster The roster holds the list of users. You can add and remove users one at a time, or in bulk by uploading a CSV file in the general Autolab format: Semester , email , last_name , first_name , school , major , year , grading_policy , courseNumber , courseLecture , section or in the format that is exported by the CMU S3 service: \"Semester\" , \"Course\" , \"Section\" , \"Lecture\" , \"Mini\" , \"Last Name\" , \"First Name\" , \"MI\" , \"AndrewID\" , \"Email\" , \"College\" , \"Department\" ,... Attention CMU Instructors: S3 lists each student twice: once in a lecture roster, which lists the lecture number (e.g., 1, 2,...) in the section field, and once in a section roster, which lists the section letter (e.g., A, B,...) in the section field. Be careful not to import the lecture roster. Instead, export and upload each section individually. Or you can export everything from S3 with a single action, edit out the roster entries for the lecture(s), and then upload a single file to Autolab with all of the sections. For the bulk upload, you can choose to either: add any new students in the roster file to the Autolab roster, or to update the Autolab roster by marking students missing from roster files as dropped . Instructors and course assistants are never marked as dropped. User accounts are never deleted. Students marked as dropped can still see their work, but cannot submit new work and do not appear on the instructor gradebook. Instructors can change the dropped status of a student at any time. Once a student is added to the roster for a course, then that course becomes visible to the student when they visit the Autolab site. A student can be enrolled in an arbitrary number of Autolab courses. Labs (Assessments) A lab (or assessment ) is broadly defined as a submission set; it is anything that your students make submissions (handins) for. This could be a programming assignment, a typed homework, or even an in-class exam. You can create labs from scratch, or reuse them from previous semesters. See the companion Guide For Lab Authors for info on writing and installing labs. Assessment Categories You can tag each assessment with an arbitrary user-defined category , e.g., \"Lab\", \"Exam\", \"Homework\". Autograders and Scoreboards Labs can be autograded or not, at your disrcretion. When a student submits to an autograded lab, Autolab runs an instructor-supplied autograder program that assigns scores to one or more problems associated with the lab. Autograded labs can have an optional scoreboard that shows (anonymized) results in real-time. See the companion Guide For Lab Authors for details on writing autograded labs with scoreboards. Important Dates A lab has a start date , due date , end date and grading deadline . The link to a lab becomes visible to students after the start date (it's always visible to instructors). Students can submit until the due date without penalty or consuming grace days. Submission is turned off after the end date. Grades are included in the gradebook's category and course averages only after the grading deadline. Handins Once an assessment is live (past the start date), students can begin submitting handins, where each handin is a single file, which can be either a text file or an archive file (e.g., mm.c , handin.tar ). Penalties and Extensions You can set penalties for late handins, set hard limits on the number of handins, or set soft limits that penalize excessive handins on a sliding scale. You can also give a student an extension that extends the due dates and end dates for that student. Grace Days Autolab provides support for a late handin policy based on grace days . Each student has a semester-long budget of grace days that are automatically applied if they handin after the due date. Each late day consumes one of the budgeted grace days. The Autolab system keeps track of the number of grace days that have been used by each student to date. If students run out of grace days and handin late, then there is a fixed late penalty (possibly zero) that can be set by the instructor. Problems Each lab contains at least one problem , defined by the instructor, with some point value. Each problem has a name (e.g., \"Prob1\", \"Style\") that is unique for the lab (although different labs can have the same problem names). Submissions Once an assessment is live (past the start date), students can begin making submissions (handins), where each submission is a single file. Grades Grades come in a number of different forms: Problem scores: These are scalar values (possibly negative) assigned per problem per submission, either manually by a human grader after the end date, or automatically by an autograder after each submission. Problem scores can also be uploaded (imported) in bulk from a CSV file. Assessment raw score: By default, the raw score is the sum of the individual problem scores, before any penalties are applied. You can override the default raw score calculation. See below. Assessment total score: The total score is the raw score, plus any late penalties, plus any instructor tweaks . Category averages: This is the average for a particular student over all assessments in a specific instructor-defined category such as \"Labs, or \"Exams\". By default the category average is the arithmetic mean of all assessment total scores, but it can be overwridden. See below. Course Average: By default, the course average is average of all category averages, but can be overidden. See below. Submissions can be classified as one of three types: \"Normal\", \"No Grade\" or \"Excused\". A \"No Grade\" submission will show up in the gradebook as NG and a zero will be used when calculating averages. An \"Excused\" submission will show up in the gradebook as EXC and will not be used when calculating averages. Overriding Raw Score Calculations Autolab computes raw scores for a lab with a Ruby function called raw_score . The default is the sum of the individual problem scores. But you can change this by providing your own raw_score function in <labname>.rb file. For example, to override the raw_score calculation for a lab called malloclab , you might add the following raw_score function to malloclab/malloclab.rb : # In malloclab/malloclab.rb file def raw_score ( score ) perfindex = score [ \"Autograded Score\" ]. to_f () heap = score [ \"Heap Checker\" ]. to_f () style = score [ \"Style\" ]. to_f () deduct = score [ \"CorrectnessDeductions\" ]. to_f () perfpoints = perfindex # perfindex below 50 gets autograded score of 0. if perfindex < 50 . 0 then perfpoints = 0 else perfpoints = perfindex end return perfpoints + heap + style + deduct end This particular lab has four problems called \"Autograded Score\", \"Heap Checker\", \"Style\", and \"CorrectnessDeductions\". An \"Autograded Score\" less than 50 is set to zero when the raw score is calculated. Note: To make this change live, you must select the \"Reload config file\" option on the malloclab page. Overriding Category and Course Averages The average for a category foo is calculated by a default Ruby function called fooAverage , which you can override in the course.rb file. For example, in our course, we prefer to report the \"average\" as the total number of normalized points (out of 100) that the student has accrued so far. This helps them understand where they stand in the class, e.g., \"Going into the final exam (worth 30 normalized points), I have 60 normalized points, so the only way to get an A is to get 100% on the final.\" Here's the Ruby function for category \"Lab\": # In course.rb file def LabAverage ( user ) pts = ( user [ 'datalab' ]. to_f () / 63 . 0 ) * 6 . 0 + ( user [ 'bomblab' ]. to_f () / 70 . 0 ) * 5 . 0 + ( user [ 'attacklab' ]. to_f () / 100 . 0 ) * 4 . 0 + ( user [ 'cachelab' ]. to_f () / 60 . 0 ) * 7 . 0 + ( user [ 'tshlab' ]. to_f () / 110 . 0 ) * 8 . 0 + ( user [ 'malloclab' ]. to_f () / 120 . 0 ) * 12 . 0 + ( user [ 'proxylab' ]. to_f () / 100 . 0 ) * 8 . 0 return pts . to_f () . round ( 2 ) end In this case, labs are worth a total of 50/100 normalized points. The assessment called datalab is graded out of a total of 63 points and is worth 6/50 normalized points. Here is the Ruby function for category \"Exam\": # In course.rb file def ExamAverage ( user ) pts = (( user [ 'midterm' ]. to_f () / 60 . 0 ) * 20 . 0 ) + (( user [ 'final' ]. to_f () / 80 . 0 ) * 30 . 0 ) return pts . to_f () . round ( 2 ) end In this case, exams are worth 50/100 normalized points. The assessment called midterm is graded out of total of 60 points and is worth 20/50 normalized points. The course average is computed by a default Ruby function called courseAverage , which can be overridden by the course.rb file in the course directory. Here is the function for our running example: # In course.rb file def courseAverage ( user ) pts = user [ 'catLab' ]. to_f () + user [ 'catExam' ]. to_f () return pts . to_f () . round ( 2 ) end In this course, the course average is the sum of the category averages for \"Lab\" and \"Exam\". Note: To make these changes live, you must select \"Reload course config file\" on the \"Manage course\" page. Handin History For each lab, students can view all of their submissions, including any source code, and the problem scores, penalties, and total scores associated with those submissions, via the handin history page. Gradesheet The gradesheet (not to be confused with the gradebook ) is the workhorse grading tool. Each assessment has a separate gradesheet with the following features: Provides an interface for manually entering problem scores (and problem feedback) for the most recent submmission from each student. Provides an interface for viewing and annotating the submitted code. Displays the problem scores for the most recent submission for each student, summarizes any late penalties, and computes the total score. Provides a link to each student's handin history. Gradebook The gradebook comes in two forms. The student gradebook displays the grades for a particular student, including total scores for each assessment, category averages, and the course average. The instructor gradebook is a table that displays the grades for the most recent submission of each student, including assessment total scores, category averages and course average. For the gradebook calculations, submissions are classified as one of three types: \"Normal\", \"No Grade\" or \"Excused\". A \"No Grade\" submission will show up in the gradebook as NG and a zero will be used when calculating averages. An \"Excused\" submission will show up in the gradebook as EXC and will not be used when calculating averages.

You can release grades on an individual basis while grading, or release all available grades in bulk by using the \"Release all grades\" option.

Writing Autograders An autograder is a program that takes a student's work as input, and generates some quantitative evaluation of that work as output. The student's work consists of one or more source files written in an arbitrary programming language. The autograder processes these files and generates arbitrary text lines on stdout. The last text line on stdout must be a JSON string, called an autoresult , that assigns an autograded score to one or more problems, and optionally, generates the scoreboard entries for this submission. The JSON autoresult is a \"scores\" hash that assigns a numerical score to one or more problems, and an optional \"scoreboard\" array that provides the scoreboard entries for this submission. For example, { \"scores\" : { \"Prob1\" : 10 , \"Prob2\" : 5 } } assigns 10 points to \"Prob1\" and 5 points to \"Prob2\" for this submission. The names of the problems must exactly match the names of the problems for this lab on the Autolab web site. Not all problems need to be autograded. For example, there might be a problem for this assessment called \"Style\" that you grade manually after the due date. If you used the Autolab web site to configure a scoreboard for this lab with three columns called \"Prob1\", \"Prob2\", and \"Total\", then the autoresult might be: { \"scores\" : { \"Prob1\" : 10 , \"Prob2\" : 5 }, \"scoreboard\" : [ 10 , 5 , 15 ] } By convention, an autograder accepts an optional -A command line argument that tells it to emit the JSON autoresult. So if you run the autograder outside of the context of Autolab, you can suppress the autoresult line by calling the autograder without the -A argument. One of the nice properties of Autolab autograders is that they can be written and tested offline, without requiring any interaction with Autolab. Writing autograders is not easy, but the fact that they can be developed offline allows you to develop and test them in your own familiar computing environment. Installing Autograded Labs After you've written and tested the autograder, you then use the Autolab web site to create the autograded lab. Autolab supports creating new labs from scratch, or reusing labs from previous semesters. We'll describe each of these in turn. Creating an Autograded Lab from Scratch Step 1: Create the new lab. Create a new lab by clicking the \"Install Assessment\" button and choosing \"Option 1: Create a New Assessment from Scratch.\" For course <course> and lab <lab> , this will create a lab directory in the Autolab file hierarchy called courses/<course>/<lab> . This initial directory contains a couple of config files and a directory called <lab>/handin that will contain all of the student handin files. In general, you should never modify any of these. Attention CMU Lab Authors At CMU, the lab directory is called /afs/cs/academic/class/<course>/autolab/<lab> . For example: /afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f16/autolab/foo is the lab directory for the lab named foo for the Fall 2016 instance of 15-213. All lab-related files must go in this autolab directory to avoid permissions issues. Step 2: Configure the lab for autograding. Using the \"Edit Assessment\" page, turn on autograding for this lab by selecting \"Add Autograder.\" You will be asked for the name of the image to be used for autograding this lab. The default image distributed with Autolab is an Ubuntu image called autograding_image . If your class needs different software, then you or your facilities staff will need to update the default image or create a new one. Attention CMU Lab Authors The default autograding image at CMU is called rhel.img and is a copy of the software on the CMU Andrew machines ( linux.andrew.cmu.edu ). If you need custom software installed, please send mail to autolab-help@andrew.cmu.edu. If you want a scoreboard, you should select \"Add Scoreboard,\" which will allow you to specify the number of columns and their names. The \"Add Scoreboard\" page contains a tutorial on how to do this. You'll also need to define the names and point values for all the problems in this lab, including the autograded ones. Each student submission is a single file, either a text source file or an archive file containing multiple files and directories. You'll need to specify the base name for the student submission files (e.g., mm.c , handin.tar ). Step 3: Add the required autograding files. For an autograded lab, Autolab expects the following two autograding files in the lab directory: autograde-Makefile : runs the autograder on a student submission. autograde.tar : contains all of the files (except for the student handin file) that are needed for autograding. Each time a student submits their work or an instructor requests a regrade, Autolab copies the student handin file, along with the two autograding files, to an empty directory on an autograding instance , renames the student handin file to base name (e.g., hello.c, handin.tar), renames autograde-Makefile to Makefile , executes the command make on the autograding instance, and finally captures the stdout generated by the autograder, and parses the resulting JSON autoresult to determine the autograded scores. Importing an Autograded Lab from a Previous Semester If you've created a lab for a course in a previous semester and have access to the lab directory (as we do at CMU via AFS), you can import the lab into your current course by copying the lab directory from the previous course to the current course, cleaning out the handin directory, then visiting the \"Install Assessment\" page and selecting \"Option 2: Import an existing assessment from the file system.\" Autolab will give you a list of all of the directories that appear to be uninstalled labs, from which you can select your particular lab. If you don't have access to the lab directory, another option is to import a lab from a tarball that was created by running \"Export assessment\" in an instance of a lab from a previous semester. Visit the \"Install Assessment\" page and select \"Option 3: Import an existing assessment from tarball.\" This will upload the tarball, create a new lab directory by expanding the tarball, and then import the directory. Example: Hello Lab In this section we'll look at the simplest possible autograded lab we could imagine, called, appropriately enough, the Hello Lab (with tarball ), which is stored in a lab directory called hello in the Autolab github repo. While it's trivial, it illustrates all of the aspects of developing an autograded lab, and provides a simple example that you can use for sanity testing on your Autolab installation. In this lab, students are asked to write a version of the K&R \"hello, world\" program, called hello.c . The autograder simply checks that the submitted hello.c program compiles and runs with an exit status of zero. If so, the submission gets 100 points. Otherwise it gets 0 points. Directory Structure Autolab expects to find the autograde-Makefile and autograde.tar files in the hello lab directory, but otherwise places no constraints on the contents and organization of this directory. However, based on our experience, we strongly recommend a directory structure with the following form: hello/README : # Basic files created by the lab author Makefile Builds the lab from src/ README autograde-Makefile Makefile that runs the autograder src/ Contains all src files and solutions test-autograder/ For testing autograder offline writeup/ Lab writeup that students view from Autolab # Files created by running make hello-handout/ The directory that is handed out to students, created using files from src/. hello-handout.tar Archive of hello-handout directory autograde.tar File that is copied to the autograding instance (along with autograde-Makefile and student handin file) # Files created and managed by Autolab handin/ All students handin files hello.rb Config file hello.yml Database properties that persist from semester to semester log.txt Log of autograded submissions The key idea with this directory structure is to place all code for the lab in the src directory, including the autograding code and any starter code handed out to students in the handout directory ( hello-handout.tar in this example). Keeping all hard state in the src directory helps limit inconsistencies. The main makefile creates hello-handout by copying files from src , and then tars it up: hello/Makefile : # # Makefile to manage the example Hello Lab # # Get the name of the lab directory LAB = $( notdir $( PWD )) all : handout handout - tarfile handout : # Rebuild the handout directory that students download ( rm -rf $( LAB ) -handout ; mkdir $( LAB ) -handout ) cp -p src/Makefile-handout $( LAB ) -handout/Makefile cp -p src/README-handout $( LAB ) -handout/README cp -p src/hello.c-handout $( LAB ) -handout/hello.c cp -p src/driver.sh $( LAB ) -handout handout-tarfile : handout # Build *-handout.tar and autograde.tar tar cvf $( LAB ) -handout.tar $( LAB ) -handout cp -p $( LAB ) -handout.tar autograde.tar clean : # Clean the entire lab directory tree. Note that you can run # \"make clean; make\" at any time while the lab is live with no # adverse effects. rm -f *~ *.tar ( cd src ; make clean ) ( cd test-autograder ; make clean ) rm -rf $( LAB ) -handout rm -f autograde.tar # # CAREFULL!!! This will delete all student records in the logfile and # in the handin directory. Don't run this once the lab has started. # Use it to clean the directory when you are starting a new version # of the lab from scratch, or when you are debugging the lab prior # to releasing it to the students. # cleanallfiles : # Reset the lab from scratch. make clean rm -f log.txt rm -rf handin/* Filenames are disambiguated by appending -handout , which is stripped when they are copied to the handout directory. For example, src/hello.c is the instructor's solution file, and src/hello.c-handout is the starter code that is given to the students in hello-handout/hello.c . And src/README is the README for the src directory and src/README-handout is the README that is handed out to students in hello-handout/README . To build the lab, type make clean; make . You can do this as often as you like while the lab is live with no adverse effects. However, be careful to never type make cleanallfiles while the lab is live; this should only be done before the lab goes live; never during or after. Source Directory The hello/src/ directory contains all of the code files for the Hello Lab, including the files that are handed out to students: hello/src/README : # Autograder and solution files Makefile Makefile and ... README ... README for this directory driver . sh * Autograder hello . c Solution hello . c file # Files that are handed out to students Makefile - handout Makefile and ... README - handout ... README handed out to students hello . c - handout Blank hello . c file handed out to students Handout Directory The hello/hello-handout/ directory contains the files that the students will use to work on the lab. It contains no hard state, and is populated entirely with files from hello/src : hello/hello-handout/README : For this lab , you should write a tiny C program , called \"hello.c\" , that prints \"hello, world\" to stdout and then indicates success by exiting with a status of zero . To test your work: $ make clean ; make ; ./ hello To run the same autograder that Autolab will use when you submit: $ ./ driver . sh Files: README This file Makefile Compiles hello . c driver . sh Autolab autograder hello . c Empty C file that you will edit hello/hello-handout/Makefile contains the rules that compile the student source code: # Student makefile for the Hello Lab all : gcc hello.c -o hello clean : rm -rf *~ hello To compile and run their code, students type: $ make clean ; make $ ./hello Autograder The autograder for the Hello Lab is a trivially simple bash script called driver.sh that compiles and runs hello.c and verifies that it returns with an exit status of zero: hello/src/driver.sh #!/bin/bash # driver.sh - The simplest autograder we could think of. It checks # that students can write a C program that compiles, and then # executes with an exit status of zero. # Usage: ./driver.sh # Compile the code echo \"Compiling hello.c\" ( make clean ; make ) status = $? if [ ${ status } -ne 0 ] ; then echo \"Failure: Unable to compile hello.c (return status = ${ status } )\" echo \"{\\\"scores\\\": {\\\"Correctness\\\": 0}}\" exit fi # Run the code echo \"Running ./hello\" ./hello status = $? if [ ${ status } -eq 0 ] ; then echo \"Success: ./hello runs with an exit status of 0\" echo \"{\\\"scores\\\": {\\\"Correctness\\\": 100}}\" else echo \"Failure: ./hello fails or returns nonzero exit status of ${ status } \" echo \"{\\\"scores\\\": {\\\"Correctness\\\": 0}}\" fi exit For example: $ ./driver.sh # Compiling hello.c # rm -rf *~ hello # gcc hello.c -o hello # Running ./hello # Hello, world # Success: ./hello runs with an exit status of 0 # {\"scores\": {\"Correctness\": 100}} Notice that the autograder expects the hello lab on the Autolab front-end to have been defined with a problem called \"Correctness\", with a maximum value of 100 points. If you forget to define the problems listed in the JSON autoresult, scores will still be logged, but they won't be posted to the database. Required Autograding Files Autolab requires two autograding files called autograde.tar , which contains all of the code required by the autograder, and autograde-Makefile , which runs the autograder on the autograding image when each submission is graded. For the Hello Lab, autograde.tar is simply a copy of the hello-handout.tar file that is handed out to students. And here is the corresponding hello/autograde-makefile : all : tar xvf autograde.tar cp hello.c hello-handout ( cd hello-handout ; ./driver.sh ) clean : rm -rf *~ hello-handout The makefile expands autograde.tar into hello-handout , copies hello.c (the submission file) into hello-handout , changes directory to hello-handout , builds the autograder, and then runs it. Test Directory For our labs, we like to setup a test directory (called test-autograder in this example), that allows us to test our autograde-Makefile and autograde-tar files by simulating Autolab's behavior on the autograding instance. The test-autograder directory has the following form: $ cd test-autograder $ ls -l # total 3 # lrwxr-xr-x 1 droh users 21 Aug 4 16:43 Makefile -> autograde-Makefile # lrwxr-xr-x 1 droh users 16 Aug 4 16:43 autograde.tar -> autograde.tar # -rw-rw-r-- 1 droh users 113 Aug 4 16:44 hello.c To simulate Autolab's behavior on an autograding instance: $ cd test-autograder && make clean && make # Running ./hello # Hello, world # Success: ./hello runs with an exit status of 0 # {\"scores\": {\"Correctness\": 100}} Writeup directory The hello/writeup contains the detailed lab writeup, either html or pdf file, that students can download from the Autolab front end. FAQ Why is Autolab not displaying my stdout output? Autolab always shows the stdout output of running make, even when the program crashed or timed out. However, when it does crash and the expected autoresult json string is not appended to the output, parsing of the last line will fail. If this happens, any stdout output that is longer than 10,000 lines will be discarded (Note that this limit does not apply when the autoresult json is valid).","title":"Guide for Lab Authors"},{"location":"lab/#guide-for-lab-authors","text":"This guide explains how to create autograded programming assignments (labs) for the Autolab system.","title":"Guide for Lab Authors"},{"location":"lab/#writing-autograders","text":"An autograder is a program that takes a student's work as input, and generates some quantitative evaluation of that work as output.

If you need custom software installed, please send mail to autolab-help@andrew.cmu.edu. If you want a scoreboard, you should select \"Add Scoreboard,\" which will allow you to specify the number of columns and their names. The \"Add Scoreboard\" page contains a tutorial on how to do this. You'll also need to define the names and point values for all the problems in this lab, including the autograded ones. Each student submission is a single file, either a text source file or an archive file containing multiple files and directories. You'll need to specify the base name for the student submission files (e.g., mm.c , handin.tar ).","title":"Step 2: Configure the lab for autograding."},{"location":"lab/#step-3-add-the-required-autograding-files","text":"For an autograded lab, Autolab expects the following two autograding files in the lab directory: autograde-Makefile : runs the autograder on a student submission. autograde.tar : contains all of the files (except for the student handin file) that are needed for autograding. Each time a student submits their work or an instructor requests a regrade, Autolab copies the student handin file, along with the two autograding files, to an empty directory on an autograding instance , renames the student handin file to base name (e.g., hello.c, handin.tar), renames autograde-Makefile to Makefile , executes the command make on the autograding instance, and finally captures the stdout generated by the autograder, and parses the resulting JSON autoresult to determine the autograded scores.","title":"Step 3: Add the required autograding files."},{"location":"lab/#importing-an-autograded-lab-from-a-previous-semester","text":"If you've created a lab for a course in a previous semester and have access to the lab directory (as we do at CMU via AFS), you can import the lab into your current course by copying the lab directory from the previous course to the current course, cleaning out the handin directory, then visiting the \"Install Assessment\" page and selecting \"Option 2: Import an existing assessment from the file system.\" Autolab will give you a list of all of the directories that appear to be uninstalled labs, from which you can select your particular lab. If you don't have access to the lab directory, another option is to import a lab from a tarball that was created by running \"Export assessment\" in an instance of a lab from a previous semester. Visit the \"Install Assessment\" page and select \"Option 3: Import an existing assessment from tarball.\" This will upload the tarball, create a new lab directory by expanding the tarball, and then import the directory.","title":"Importing an Autograded Lab from a Previous Semester"},{"location":"lab/#example-hello-lab","text":"In this section we'll look at the simplest possible autograded lab we could imagine, called, appropriately enough, the Hello Lab (with tarball ), which is stored in a lab directory called hello in the Autolab github repo. While it's trivial, it illustrates all of the aspects of developing an autograded lab, and provides a simple example that you can use for sanity testing on your Autolab installation. In this lab, students are asked to write a version of the K&R \"hello, world\" program, called hello.c . The autograder simply checks that the submitted hello.c program compiles and runs with an exit status of zero. If so, the submission gets 100 points. Otherwise it gets 0 points.","title":"Example: Hello Lab"},{"location":"lab/#directory-structure","text":"Autolab expects to find the autograde-Makefile and autograde.tar files in the hello lab directory, but otherwise places no constraints on the contents and organization of this directory. However, based on our experience, we strongly recommend a directory structure with the following form: hello/README : # Basic files created by the lab author Makefile Builds the lab from src/ README autograde-Makefile Makefile that runs the autograder src/ Contains all src files and solutions test-autograder/ For testing autograder offline writeup/ Lab writeup that students view from Autolab # Files created by running make hello-handout/ The directory that is handed out to students, created using files from src/. hello-handout.tar Archive of hello-handout directory autograde.tar File that is copied to the autograding instance (along with autograde-Makefile and student handin file) # Files created and managed by Autolab handin/ All students handin files hello.rb Config file hello.yml Database properties that persist from semester to semester log.txt Log of autograded submissions The key idea with this directory structure is to place all code for the lab in the src directory, including the autograding code and any starter code handed out to students in the handout directory ( hello-handout.tar in this example). Keeping all hard state in the src directory helps limit inconsistencies. The main makefile creates hello-handout by copying files from src , and then tars it up: hello/Makefile : # # Makefile to manage the example Hello Lab # # Get the name of the lab directory LAB = $( notdir $( PWD )) all : handout handout - tarfile handout : # Rebuild the handout directory that students download ( rm -rf $( LAB ) -handout ; mkdir $( LAB ) -handout ) cp -p src/Makefile-handout $( LAB ) -handout/Makefile cp -p src/README-handout $( LAB ) -handout/README cp -p src/hello.c-handout $( LAB ) -handout/hello.c cp -p src/driver.sh $( LAB ) -handout handout-tarfile : handout # Build *-handout.tar and autograde.tar tar cvf $( LAB ) -handout.tar $( LAB ) -handout cp -p $( LAB ) -handout.tar autograde.tar clean : # Clean the entire lab directory tree.

This will delete all student records in the logfile and # in the handin directory.

For example, src/hello.c is the instructor's solution file, and src/hello.c-handout is the starter code that is given to the students in hello-handout/hello.c . And src/README is the README for the src directory and src/README-handout is the README that is handed out to students in hello-handout/README . To build the lab, type make clean; make .

Provision a Server Server If you don't already have a server, we recommend a VPS (virtual private server). Here are a couple popular VPS providers: DigitalOcean (recommended) Amazon Lightsail Google Cloud Platform Domain name (A domain name is both required by SSL and email service.) In your DNS provider: Add www and @ records pointing to the ip address of your server. Add DKIM and SFF records by creating TXT records after you finish the email service part. SSL You can run Autolab with or without HTTPS encryption. We strongly recommend you run it with HTTPS. Here are a few options to get the SSL certificate and key: Go through your school/organization Many universities have a program whereby they'll grant SSL certificates to students and faculty for free. Some of these programs require you to be using a school-related domain name, but some don't. You should be able to find out more information from your school's IT department. Use paid service: SSLmate You can follow this simple guide to get your paid SSL with SSLMate in the simplest way. Email Service Autolab uses email for various features, include sending out user confirmation emails and instructor-to-student bulk emails. You can use MailChimp + Mandrill to configure transactional email. Create a MailChimp account here Add Mandrill using these instructions Go to the settings page and create a new API key From the Mailchimp/Mandrill Domains settings page, add your domain Configure the DKIM and SFF settings by creating TXT records with your DNS provider (they link to some instructions for how to do this, but the process will differ depending on which DNS provider you are using.

Authentication In order to have access to the REST interface of the Tango server, clients will first have to obtain a key from the Tango server. This key is a unique identifier of the client and it must be supplied with every HTTP request to the Tango server. If the Tango server fails to recognize the key, it does not entertain the request and returns an error message as part of the response body. Job Requests Here is a description of the requests that clients use to submit jobs: open A request to open consists of the client's key and an identifier for every lab, which is likely to be a combination of the course name and the lab name (i.e. courselab for autograding jobs). open checks if a directory for courselab exists. If a directory for courselab exists, a dict of MD5 hashes corresponding to every file in that directory is returned. If the directory does not exist, it is created and a folder for output files is also created within the courselab directory. Since no files exist in the newly created directory, an empty dict of MD5 hashes is returned. Request header: GET /open/key/courselab/ Request body: empty Response body: { \"statusMsg\" : <string> , \"statusId\" : <int> , \"files\" : { <fileName1> : <md5hash1>, <fileName2> : <md5hash2> ... }, } upload After receiving a list of MD5 hashes of files that exist on the Tango server, the client can choose to upload files that are different from the ones on the Tango server via successive upload commands. For each upload, the client must supply a filename header that gives the name of the file (on the local machine) to be uploaded to Tango. One of these files must be a Makefile, which needs to contain a rule called autograde (command to drive the autograding process). Request header: POST /upload/key/courselab/ Request body: <file> Response body: { \"statusMsg\" : <string> , \"statusId\" : <int> } addJob After uploading the appropriate files, the client uses this command to run the job for the files specified as files in the courselab and on an instance of a particular VM image . Each file has localFile and destFile attributes which specify what the file is called on the Tango server and what it should be called when copied over to a VM (for autograding) respectively. Exactly one of the specified files should have the destFile attribute set to Makefile , and the Makefile must contain a rule called autograde . Clients can also specify an optional timeout value ( timeout ) and maximum output file size ( max_kb ). This command is non-blocking and returns immediately with a status message. Additionally, the command accepts an optional parameter, callback_url . If the callback_url is specified, then the Tango server sends a POST request to the callback_url with the output file once the job is terminated. If the callback_url is not specified, the client can then send a poll request for the output_file to check the status of that job and retrieve the output file from the Tango server if autograding is complete. Request header: POST /addJob/key/courselab/ Request body: { \"image\" : <string> , # required VM image (e.g. \"rhel.img\" ) \"files\" : [ { \"localFile\" : <string> , \"destFile\" : <string> }, ... ], # required list of files to be used for autograding \"jobName\" : <string> , # required name of job \"output_file\" : <string> , # required name of output file \"timeout\" : <int> , # optional timeout value (secs) \"max_kb\" : <int> , # optional max output file size (KB) \"callback_url\" : <string> # optional URL for POST callback from server to client } Response body: { \"statusMsg\" : <string> , \"statusId\" : <int> , \"jobId\" : <int> } poll Check if the job for outputFile has completed.

Note that for certain implementations, some of these methods will be no-ops since the VMMS doesn't require any particular instructions to perform the specified actions. Furthermore, throughout this document, we use the term \"VM\" liberally to represent any container-like object on which Tango jobs may be run. initializeVM initializeVM ( self , vm ) Creates a new VM instance for the VMMS based on the fields of vm , which is a TangoMachine object defined in tangoObjects.py . waitVM waitVM ( self , vm , max_secs ) Waits at most max_secs for a VM to be ready to run jobs. Returns an error if the VM is not ready after max_secs . copyIn copyIn ( self , vm , inputFiles ) Copies the input files for a job into the VM. inputFiles is a list of InputFile objects defined in tangoObjects.py . For each InputFile object, file.localFile is the name of the file on the Tango host machine and file.destFile is what the name of the file should be on the VM. runJob runJob ( self , vm , runTimeout , maxOutputFileSize ) Runs the autodriver binary on the VM. The autodriver runs make on the VM (which in turn runs the job via the Makefile that was provided as a part of the input files for the job). The output from the autodriver most likely should be redirected to some feedback file to be used in the next method of the API. copyOut copyOut ( self , vm , destFile ) Copies the output file for the job out of the VM into destFile on the Tango host machine. destroyVM destroyVM ( self , vm ) Removes a VM from the Tango system. safeDestroyVM safeDestroyVM ( self , vm ) Removes a VM from the Tango system and makes sure that it has been removed. getVMs getVMs ( self ) Returns a complete list of VMs associated with this Tango system. Docker VMMS Setup This is a guide to set up Tango to run jobs inside Docker containers. Install docker on host machine by following instructions on the docker installation page . Ensure docker is running: $ docker ps # CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Build base Docker image from root Tango directory. cd path/to/Tango docker build -t autograding_image vmms/ docker images autograding_image # Check if image built Update VMMS_NAME in config.py . # in config.py VMMS_NAME = \"localDocker\" Amazon EC2 VMMS Setup This is a guide to set up Tango to run jobs on an Amazon EC2 VM. Create an AWS Account or use an existing one. Obtain your access_key_id and secret_access_key by following the instructions here . Add AWS Credentials to a file called ~/.boto using the following format: [ Credentials ] aws_access_key_id = MYAMAZONTESTKEY12345 aws_secret_access_key = myawssecretaccesskey12345 Tango uses the Boto Python package to interface with Amazon Web Services In the AWS EC2 console, create an Ubuntu 14.04+ EC2 instance and save the .pem file in a safe location. Copy the directory and contents of autodriver/ in the Tango repo into the EC2 VM. For more help connecting to the EC2 instance follow this guide chmod 400 /path/my-key-pair.pem scp -i /path/my-key-pair.pem -r autodriver/ ubuntu@<ec2-host-name>.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/ The autodriver is used as a sandbox environment to run the job inside the VM. It limits Disk I/O, Disk Usage, monitors security, and controls other valuable sudo level resources. In the EC2 VM, compile the autodriver. $ cd autodriver/ $ make clean ; make $ cp -p autodriver /usr/bin/autodriver Create the autograde Linux user and directory. All jobs will be run under this user. $ useradd autograde $ mkdir autograde $ chown autograde autograde $ chown :autograde autograde In the AWS EC2 console, create an AMI image from your EC2 VM.
